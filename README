Flip Phone Resale â€” Static Website

Structure:
- index.html, shop.html, sell.html, about.html, cart.html, checkout.html
- styles.css (shared styles, cleaned and commented)
- common.js (cart, checkout, quote logic, cleaned and commented)
- images/ (12 product JPGs; placeholders for now)

How to run locally:
- Open index.html or shop.html in a browser.

Notes:
- Product images are placeholders (from placehold.co). Replace with real product photos later, keeping the same filenames.
- Cart uses localStorage; clearing browser storage resets it.
- Checkout generates a mock order ID and displays a summary (no payments).

Next steps:
- Create GitHub repo and push this folder.
- Enable GitHub Pages for a live URL.
- Replace placeholder images with production images.
